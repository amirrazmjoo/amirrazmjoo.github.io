I am a PhD student at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL)](https://www.epfl.ch) and a research assistant in the **Robot Learning and Interaction (RLI) Group** at the [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch/), supervised by [Dr. Sylvain Calinon](https://calinon.ch/).  

My research focuses on **controlling robots in highly constrained scenarios**, such as humanoid robots interacting with users or robotic systems manipulating objects in **contact-rich environments**. I am passionate about developing **adaptive, efficient, and intelligent robotic control methods** that enable robots to interact with the world more naturally and safely.  To achieve this, I explore **Generative AI** (e.g., diffusion models, flow matching), **Model composition** (e.g., product of experts), **System dynamics**, **control theory**, and **Physics-based simulation** (e.g., Isaac Sim) . 

I am particularly excited about **bridging the gap between theory and real-world robotic applications**, leveraging AI-driven models to enhance **robot autonomy and interaction**. My goal is to push the boundaries of robotic learning and control, making robots more **intuitive, adaptable, and physically intelligent**.
